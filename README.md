# Auth0 MCP Tenant – Secure AI Action & API Orchestration

## 🚀 Overview
This project integrates **Auth0 Identity Management** with the **MCP (Model–Controller–Personality) framework** to securely govern AI actions.  
Every AI request is verified, authorized, and logged — making AI trustworthy, compliant, and business-ready.

## 🔑 Problem
AI assistants are powerful but risky:
- No clear boundaries on what they can access
- Lack of auditability
- Hard to scale securely

---

## ✅ Solution
Auth0 MCP Tenant = **Identity-first AI Orchestration**

1. **Login with Auth0** → User gets a secure token.  
2. **Request an AI Action** → e.g., "Get sales report."  
3. **Auth0 Verifies Permissions** → Issues a scoped, one-time-use token.  
4. **AI Executes Task** → Only what the token allows.  
5. **Audit Trail** → Every action is logged with identity and timestamp.
